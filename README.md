# Image_Processing_Implementations

I have saved every single function that about image processing that for my course homeworks.
My intention to help to people these are struggling with understanding of image processing or computer vision courses.

You can do whatever you want from my code. 

Oh BTW you can find a project that named as "slope_detector" that was project for my course. Maybe this project help you to understand my functions for how to use it.
